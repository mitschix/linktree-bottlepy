# linktree-bottlepy
bottle template for a linktree

Before you can use the bottle server make sure you install the dependencies with `pip` and
copy the template user data file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp userdata.py.template userdata.py
```

Furthmore you have to add your own profile picture at *static/me.jpg* and add your informations
into the userdata.py file. You can leave the information empty if you do not need them (e.g. if you do not have facebook)
**sname** stands for **shortname** or your **nickname**.

! The template for the linktree website is from this [repository](https://github.com/MichaelBarney/LinkFree/tree/master/Templates/DarkMode) and only slightly modified.
